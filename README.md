Utilizing Python for hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics, the aim is to derive insights that can assist taxi drivers in maximizing earnings. Specifically, the goal is to determine whether there exists a substantial disparity in fares between customers paying with credit cards versus those paying with cash.
