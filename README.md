# Maximizing Revenue Using Hypothesis Testing

## Objective

The Primary Objective of  this Project is to A/B test to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment. Utilizing Python for hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics, the aim is to derive insights that can assist taxi drivers in maximizing earnings. Specifically, the goal is to determine whether there exists a substantial disparity in fares between customers paying with credit cards versus those paying with cash.

## Insights Gained Through Analysis

+ Customers paying with cards tend to have a slightly higher average trip distance and fare amount compared to those paying with cash.
+ Indicates that customers prefers to pay more with cards when they have high fare amount and long trip distance.
+ The Proportion of customers paying with cards is significantly higher than those paying with cards, with card payments accounting for 67.5% of all transactions compared to cash payments at 32.5%.
+ This indicates a strong performance among customers for using card payments over cash, potentially due to convenience, security, or incentives offered for card transactions.
